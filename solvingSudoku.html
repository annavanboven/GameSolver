        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        A Sudoku board is made up of a 9x9 grid of 81 boxes. The grid includes 9 subgrids
        of size 3x3. The puzzle is solved when each of the 81 boxes contain an integer 
        between 1 and 9, and all of the integers 1-9 appear in every row, column, and
        3x3 subgrid of the board. The board starts with preset or "fixed" numbers 
        that cannot be changed. The player's task is to solve the puzzle by filling in the
        remaining boxes.

        <h2>The Sudoku Solver</h2>
        <p>Sudoku is a type of Constraint Satisfaction Problem, or
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">CSP</a>.
        The solver uses the Arc Consistency Algorithm #3 ( 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-3_algorithm">AC-3</a>), and
        <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a> with the
        Minimum Remaining Values and degree heuristics.</p>

        <h3>AC-3</h3>
        <p>To use AC-3, first every box of the cell is given a domain of possible integers 1-9,
        with the exception of the boxes with fixed starting values. For fixed boxes, the domain
        consists of the fixed value.</p>
        
        <p>Next, a list of constraints is created for each
        box. For example, the box at (row, column) = (1,1) must not have the same value
        as any box in its row (e.g. the boxes at (1,1), (1,2), ... (1,9)), any box in its
        column (i.e. (2,1), (3,1), ... (9,1)), or any box in its subgrid (i.e. (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)
        (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)). Leaving out repeats, these represent the 20 constraints for box (1,1).</p>

        <p>AC-3 progresses by going through the list of constraints one by one. For each box x<sub>i</sub> and
        constraining box x<sub>j</sub>, if there is a single value in the domain of x<sub>j</sub>, that value is 
        removed from the domain of x<sub>i</sub>. If this causes the domain of x<sub>i</sub> to contain only a 
        single value, then a new set of "reverse 
        constraints" is added to the list of constraints, to be worked through. For the reverse constraints,
        the box that was previously x<sub>i</sub> becomes the constraining box x<sub>j</sub> for all the boxes 
        that share its row,
        column, and subgrid.</p>

        <p>After all the constraints have been worked through, the puzzle may not be completely solved. Thus
        AC-3 is not necessarily sufficient to find a solution, if one exists. In this case, another method is
        needed.</p>

        <h3>Backtracking</h3>
        <p>Backtracking is basically a trial-and-error method for solving the puzzle. For an empty Sudoku box, 
        a value is selected from the domain of allowable values that fit the constraints. These could be chosen
        randomly, in order, or using a heuristic as described below. The box is filled in with the guess value,
        and then used to constrain the boxes that share the row, column, and subgrid. The process is repeated 
        for another empty Sudoku box, new constraints are accounted for, and so on. 
        This continues until either the puzzle is solved, or a box 
        is found to have no allowable value  (because all values 1-9 are already present in the row, column, and subgrid). 
        If there is no allowable value, the algorithm "backtracks" to the last box that had multiple values
        in its domain, emptying boxes as it backs up. A different value from the domain is tried, and the algorithm
        proceeds forward again for as long as it can. Because of the need to undo changes when the algorithm
        backtracks, recursion is generally used.</p>

        <p>Backtracking can be used alone or in conjuction with another method like AC-3. For example, if
        AC-3 fails to complete the puzzle, backtracking can take over. Unlike AC-3, backtracking can almost
        always solve a Sudoku puzzle if it is solveable. Backtracking can be done in any order, as long as
        it avoids repeating.
        </p>

        <h3>Heuristics</h3>
        <p>To speed up the solver, heuristics can be used. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">
        heuristic</a> is a problem-solving technique "that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, 
        but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation". When using
        backtracking, it makes sense to use a heuristic to chose the next box that will be filled in with an 
        allowed guess. One reasonable heuristic is to choose the box with the shortest list of allowable values - 
        the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic.  Another useful heuristic, which can be used together with MRV,
        is the degree heuristic, which chooses the variable involved in the largest number of constraints with remaining 
        unassigned variables.</p>
